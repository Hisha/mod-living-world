-- Kalimdor authored Hunt final encounter sites
-- Includes Kalimdor proper plus Azuremyst Isle and Bloodmyst Isle, which are treated as Kalimdor by Living World hunt scope.
-- Three manually verified locations per hunt zone, authored in-game with
-- .lw hunt set final point.
--
-- location_name is intentionally blank. HuntManager resolves the sub-area name
-- from AreaTable.dbc at runtime using the authored coordinates and the player's
-- DBC locale, with the hunt-zone name as a fallback.
